## Introduction
Arch_LTN is a modification of Pointcept, designed to enhance and extend its capabilities for advanced point cloud processing tasks, with a focus on integrating Neuro-Symbolic AI techniques for the Arch Dataset.

## Features
- Enhanced point cloud transformation capabilities.
- Kept the modular and extensible architecture.
- Compatibility with Pointcept workflows.
- Integration of Neuro-Symbolic AI for advanced reasoning.

## Additions

Train.sh now takes the -t option, to freely change the train python script.
This was done in the purpose of adding a separate train script for LTN_Torch extensions.

## Installation
To install Arch_LTN, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Arch_LTN.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Arch_LTN`
3. Install dependencies: Use the guide on the pointcept github, you just need to add neptune

## Usage
Follow the guide on the pointcept github.

## Examples

## Neuro-Symbolic AI
Arch_LTN incorporates Neuro-Symbolic AI techniques to enhance its reasoning capabilities. This integration allows the model to combine symbolic logic with neural network-based learning, making it particularly effective for tasks involving the Arch Dataset.
